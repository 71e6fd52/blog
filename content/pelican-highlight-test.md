Summary: Test pelican highlight

Python test:

    :::python
    print("foo")
    
```python
print("foo")
```

Inside a list:

1. Here is some text. Let us try the ::: version of syntax highlighting.

    Only four spaces to indent:

    :::python
    print("foo")

    Using eight spaces to indent:
    
        :::python
        print("foo")

2. Now let us try the \`\`\` version of syntax highlighting.

    Only four spaces to indent:

    ```python
    print("foo")
    ```

    Using eight spaces to indent:

        ```python
        print("foo")
        ```
    
End of test.
